    name: Canopy Cover
    description: The horizontal area covered by tree canopies. Maps community type & fire regime, as well as habitat for tree-dwelling species.

    name: Canopy Height
    description: The distance between the ground and the top of the canopy. Canopy height is a good proxy for aboveground biomass.

    name: Canopy Base Height
    description: The distance between the ground and the lowest branches in the canopy. Predicts whether a surface fire transitions to a canopy fire.

    name: Canopy Bulk Density
    description: The mass of available fuel that burns in a canopy fire—typically the leaves and small branches— divided by the volume of the crown.

    name: Surface Fuel Model
    description: A model describing vegetation fuel type, size class, depth, moisture content and heat content. Determines fire behavior patterns like flame length and spread rate.

    name: Ladder Fuel Density
    description: The amount of brush and/or understory fuels. Maps where low-lying surface fires are most likely transition to canopy fires.

    name: Dry Vegetation Abundance
    description: The amount of dry or dead vegetation, including dead grass, timber slash, dry brush, and leaf litter.

    name: Vertical Layer Count
    description: The number of distinct vertical canopy layers. Vertical layer count is a proxy for leaf area index, and maps canopy complexity.
