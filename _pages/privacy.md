## Privacy Policy

Effective date: September 8th, 2020

The California Forest Observatory knows you care about how your personal information is used and shared,
and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
**By using or accessing the California Forest Observatory or any Services in any manner, you acknowledge
that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that
we may collect, use, and share your information in the following ways**.

Remember that your use of the California Forest Observatory and the Services is at all times subject to
the [Terms of Use]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/terms-of-use.md %}), which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy
without defining them have the definitions given to them in the [Terms of Use]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/terms-of-use.md %}).  

### What does this Privacy Policy cover?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information")
that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t
own or control, or people that we don’t manage.  We gather various types of Personal Information from our
users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with
our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account
and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products
and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal
Information with third parties, but only as described below.

As noted in the [Terms of Use]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/terms-of-use.md %}), we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone
under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information
about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will
delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal
information, please contact us at [admin@forestobservatory.com](mailto:admin@forestobservatory.com).

### Will we ever change this Privacy Policy?

We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well,
but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email
address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and
understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree
to all of the changes.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
information is collected.

### What information do we collect?

<u>Information You Provide to Us</u>

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or
through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number,
and/or place of employment. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.  

We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address,
we may email you about your use of the Services.  Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.
This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.  If you do not
want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by updating your account preferences or emailing
us directly at [admin@forestobservatory.com](mailto:admin@forestobservatory.com).  

<u>Information Collected Automatically</u>

Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your
browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information,
the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies”
are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how
and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to change the preferences
on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking
advantage of some of our features.  If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also
transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t
responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to
track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track”
requests you have set using your browser or device.

We may use this data to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature
of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.  We may also
use it to customize content or communications for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.

<u>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</u>

Through cookies we or our service providers (such as Google Analytics) place on your browser or device, we may collect
information about your online activity after you leave our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect,
this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in
this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of
websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators
to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Services do not support Do Not
Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using
the Services and after you leave our Services.

### Will we share any of the Personal Information we collect?

We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this below:

**Information that’s been de-identified**: We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified
as an individual, and provide that information to our partners and service providers. However, we never disclose aggregate
usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would
identify you as an individual.

**Affiliated Businesses**: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may provide
products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize
when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information
with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over
the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part
in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.

**Our Agents**: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with
them to provide products or services to you.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the
Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

**User Profiles and Submissions**: If you use the user forum functionality (currently offered through Google Groups, referred
to herein as the “Forum”) the following applies to your use of that Forum (other terms and conditions from Google may also apply).
Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the
Forum, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Forum or address your request for our services.
Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you
voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly
available, and can be collected and used by anyone.  Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages
or comments or upload images or videos through the Forum and other users can contact you through messages and comments.

**Protection of Salo and Others**: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably
believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms and other agreements; or protect the rights,
property, or safety of Salo, our employees, our users, or others.

### Is Personal Information about me secure?

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and
Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and
browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately,
we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise
the security of user information at any time.

### What Personal Information can I access?

Through the functionality of the Services, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve
provided to us:

- e-mail address
- password

The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or
updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at [admin@forestobservatory.com](mailto:admin@forestobservatory.com).

### What choices do I have?

You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or
to take advantage of some of our features.

You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain
a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such
information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after
you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

### What if I have questions about this policy?

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to
[admin@forestobservatory.com](mailto:admin@forestobservatory.com), and we will try to resolve your concerns.

**Thank you for reading**.
